# World Life Expectancy Project EDA (Exploritory Data Analysis)

-- two parts to EDA
-- usually in conjuction with data cleaning, AGG functions and group bys, looking at the data to see what can be fixed
-- the second part of EDA is done to find insights and trends in the data

SELECT *
FROM world_life_expectancy
;

-- which countries increased life expectancy the most?
-- MIN and MAX of each country 
-- GROUP BY country to get the min and max of each country


SELECT Country, MIN(`Life expectancy`), MAX(`Life expectancy`)
FROM world_life_expectancy
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY Country DESC
;

-- 0 values for `life expectancy` may be bad data quality
-- filtering out the 0 for `life expectancy`

SELECT Country, MIN(`Life expectancy`), MAX(`Life expectancy`)
FROM world_life_expectancy
GROUP BY Country
HAVING MIN(`Life expectancy`) <> 0
AND MAX(`Life expectancy`) <> 0
ORDER BY Country DESC
;

-- which countries recorded the biggest improved life expectancy?
-- this difference is rounded to 1 decimal point
-- ordered by Life_Increase_15_Years

-- County, Min/Max Life expectancy

SELECT Country,
MIN(`Life expectancy`), 
MAX(`Life expectancy`),
ROUND(MAX(`Life expectancy`) - MIN(`Life expectancy`),1) AS Life_Increase_15_Years
FROM world_life_expectancy
GROUP BY Country
HAVING MIN(`Life expectancy`) <> 0
AND MAX(`Life expectancy`) <> 0
ORDER BY Life_Increase_15_Years DESC
;

-- the average life_expectancy for each year
-- '0s' removed to prevent them from affecting the average
-- average not affected by removing '0's
-- 0's filtered out in WHERE statement 
-- HAVING statement is for AGG functions

-- Average life expectancy for each year for all countries combined

SELECT Year, ROUND(AVG(`Life expectancy`),2)
FROM world_life_expectancy
WHERE `Life expectancy` <> 0
AND `Life expectancy` <> 0
GROUP BY Year
ORDER BY Year
;
-- average increase, as a whole, from year 2007 (66.75 years) to year 2022 (71.62 years) is about 4.87 years

SELECT *
FROM world_life_expectancy


-- group by country
-- a country's average life expectancy and average GDP
-- exclude 0s
-- order by GDP

-- Life expectancy vs GDP

SELECT Country, ROUND(AVG(`Life expectancy`),1) AS Life_Exp, ROUND(AVG(GDP),1) AS GDP
FROM world_life_expectancy
GROUP BY Country
HAVING Life_Exp > 0
AND GDP > 0
ORDER BY GDP ASC
;

-- findings: Lower GDP is correlated with lower life expectancy
-- findings: Higher GDP is correlated with longer life expectancy
-- upload into data visualization software to confirm correlations

-- CASE STATEMENT
-- counting the amount of countries with a GDP over 1500, and another group of countries above 1500

-- High GDP vs Low GDP life expectancy

SELECT 
	SUM(CASE WHEN GDP >= 1500 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) High_GDP_Count,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN GDP >= 1500 THEN `Life expectancy` ELSE NULL END),1) High_GDP_Life_Expectancy,
	SUM(CASE WHEN GDP <= 1500 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) Low_GDP_Count,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN GDP <= 1500 THEN `Life expectancy` ELSE NULL END),1) Low_GDP_Life_Expectancy
FROM world_life_expectancy
;

# Findings:
-- 1326 rows have a GDP above 1500
-- countries with a GDP higher than 1500 have a life expectancy of 74 years
-- countries with a GDP lower than 1500 have a life expectancy of 65 years
-- low GDP countries have a life expectancy that is ~10 years lower than High GDP countries



-- AVG life expectancy for Developing vs Developed countries


SELECT Status, ROUND(AVG(`Life expectancy`),1)
FROM world_life_expectancy
GROUP BY Status
;

-- Findings:
-- Average life expectancy for Developing countries is 66.8 years
-- Average life expectancy for Developed countries is 79.2 years



SELECT Status, COUNT(DISTINCT Country),  ROUND(AVG(`Life expectancy`),1)
FROM world_life_expectancy
GROUP BY Status
;

-- combined the 2 above queries

# Findings
-- Count of Developed countries is 32
-- Count of Developing countries is 161
-- Life expectancy is skewed in favor of the developed countries since there are fewer of them

-- output the Country, AVG life expectancy, and AVG BMI, both rounded to the 1st decimal place
-- exclude 0 values for BMI
-- countries must have life expectancy and BMI greater than 0

SELECT Country, ROUND(AVG(`Life expectancy`),1) AS Life_Exp, ROUND(AVG(BMI),1) AS BMI
FROM world_life_expectancy
GROUP BY Country
HAVING Life_Exp > 0
AND BMI > 0
ORDER BY BMI ASC
;

# Findings
-- lower BMI is correlated with lower life expectancies


-- Rolling total for adult mortality of country and ordered by Year
-- Number of Adult Mortality compared to Life expectancy
-- Wildcard in WHERE statement selects Countries with 'United" in the name

-- Total Population vs Adult Mortality vs Life experctancy

SELECT Country,
Year,
`Life expectancy`,
`Adult Mortality`,
SUM(`Adult Mortality`) OVER(PARTITION BY Country ORDER BY Year) AS RollingTotal
FROM world_life_expectancy 
WHERE Country LIKE '%United States%'
;


-- For Year 2022, the life expectancy in United States of America was 79.3
